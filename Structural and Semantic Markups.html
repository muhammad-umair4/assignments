    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly had been starting out of here window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New, Scientist,</i> and all the other <br />
        scientific journal her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road.</cite>It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she <br />
        spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wild
        quote proclaiming <q>Work is the refuge of people who have <br /> nothing to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work,
         unravelling the secrets of the  llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid
        ">DNA,</abbr>
        to be an outstanding achievement, <br /> Molly <EM>did</EM> think she had something better to do.
